## About Me
I began my journey to start a career at the Colorado School of Mines to become a mechanical engineer. A series of factors led to my time at Mines not ending with getting a degree. Although I didnâ€™t get to start an engineering career I learned many valuable lessons as a student there. I learned how to understand and utilize complex logic and mathematics, digest difficult information into something I can understand, and I learned that I love to write code. After a few years of trying to get financially stable enough to return to school without really getting close, I was shown a new option. The prospect of attending a coding boot camp was one that made me very excited. During my time at the Turing School of Software and Design, I Learned not only how to write code but to collaborate and have synergy with other developers working on the same project. Equipped with the skills required to be a developer I am excited to bring my talents into the workforce and begin creating production software.
